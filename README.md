# Determining house prices using linear regression

This project uses linear regression on the [house prices](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) training data set using python and libraries like numpy, pandas, scikit, matplotlib, and seaborn

## Objective

To use the dataset given to perform a linear regression to predict housing prices 

## Dataset

- Source: Kaggle
- Format: CSV
- Link: [https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)
  
## Key Features
- Scatterplots
- Linear regression
- R squared, mean absolute error and root mean squared error

## Skills practiced

- Real world dataset handling
- visualization with seaborn/matplotlib
- Data Wrangling with pandas
- performing linear regression using scikitlearn
- finding R squared, mean absolute error and root mean squared error using scikitlearn

## How to Run

1. Open the juypter note book or run in google collab
2. All cells are able to be executed as is
3. go in to the kaggle link that is given and download train.csv and added it to juypter notebook or google collab
4. run the code
